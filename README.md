# The Lost Outcasts

## Introduction

I have been wanting to do some modding of Fallout NV. I have some mods for Fallout 4, and Skyrim SE. On my original playthrough of the game, I always wanted some beat up Falout 3 Outcast Power Armor. It seemed appropriate since everyone seems to want to call you an outsider.

This is my first attempt at using the FNV 1.4 GECK which is not as advanced as the Fallout 4, or Skyrim SE Creation Kits. The old GECK is the basis for the newer creation kits, but is a lot different.


## Story

The Brotherhood Outcasts of The Capital Wasteland have sent a team west to establish communications with the Western Brotherhood, and convey Elder Lyons betrayal of the Codex. Their goal was to establish communications with Hidden Valley unaware of its lockdown, and communications silence. After avoiding the Legion at the Colorado River, and determining that Hoover dam was not crossible due to NCR troops, they considered other options. They were aware of a BoS bunker (safe-house) that they would attempt to reach, and make further plans from there.

They made it to the bunker...

## Information

You will find three Brotherhood Outcasts outside of the Abandoned BoS Bunker East of Camp Forelorn Hope. Two Brotherhood Outcast Defenders equipped with standard equipment and Brotherhood Outcast T-45d Power Armor, and one named Brotherhood Outcast (Protector Bailey) that is equipped with an additional unique Laser Rifle called "Independence".
